## Description

Cutsies is our submission to *McGameJam 2020*. The theme of the game jam was "Can't go back". Our team chose to interpret this prompt with an added comma - "Can't, go back!" With this new idea, we created a line-cutting game in *Unity 3D* which the player must successfully cut in front of a whole line of people without getting called out.

## Gameplay Instructions

Objective: Cut into the line without alerting people beyond suspicion. Make it to the bouncer.
Controls: Move with WASD.

## Running Instructions

1. Download the release zip.
2. Run GameJam2020.exe.
